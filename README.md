# Focus Areas
I prioritized implementing robust networking and image caching systems. These components are critical for performance and user experience in data-driven applications. While I'm comfortable with UI development, I chose to challenge myself in these areas to strengthen my skills in handling asynchronous operations and memory management.
The image caching system ensures efficient loading of recipe images while minimizing network requests and memory usage. The network manager provides a clean abstraction for API interactions with proper error handling.
# Time Spent
I dedicated approximately 4 hours to this project, distributed as follows:
  - Research and implementation of the image caching system: ~1.5 hours
  - Network manager and data handling: ~1 hour
  - Unit testing: ~1 hour
  - UI implementation and refinement: ~0.5 hours
# Trade-offs and Decisions
Given the time constraints, I made several strategic decisions:
  - Focused on core functionality over UI embellishments
  - Prioritized code quality and architecture over feature quantity
  - Implemented a simple but effective error handling system
# Areas for Improvement
If given more time, I would enhance the following aspects:
  - UI design and animations - The current interface is functional but could benefit from more engaging visual elements and smoother transitions
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality - The current implementation works but lacks polish in terms of animation and user feedback
  - Additional features - Such as recipe filtering, search functionality, and favorites storage
# Additional Information
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this challenge. I look forward to discussing my implementation decisions and how they align with your team's practices.
